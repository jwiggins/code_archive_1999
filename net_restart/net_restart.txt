  Description:  net_restart restarts networking from the command line
        Notes:  this pogram was a quick hack for me to kill off dead socket[] threads
	 when I wasn't in front of my computer. It has saved me gas money already :)
	Now with (real) error checking! :) Now kills and restarts message_daemon too
