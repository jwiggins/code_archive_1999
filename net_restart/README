net_restart v1.2 John Wiggins
----------------
This program is freeware. If you would really like to pay me something for it 
because it has changed your life of something, send money(preferably) or free 
copies of software you have made to:

v1.0
---------------
- initial release

v1.1
---------------
- error checking and retries! woohoo.

v1.2
---------------
- real error checking..... (didnt have the BeBook when i did the first "error checking")
- Big Thank You to Sebastien Bouchex for pointing out the nasty bug that would kill your 
	system if net_server was already dead or otherwise not running.

v1.3
---------------
- message_daemon reeaally hate having net_server killed while its running, so now i kill it first and restart it when im done.

btw: the author of this app would like to thank the author of Jukebox, who 
kindly explained the wonders of BMessaging, and basically wrote this program :)
and Sebastien Bouchex, who corrected my serious error.

Some things you should know about this software:
-----------------------------------------------
- This app does not kill the telnet session (just the networking it relies on) that you are in the middle of. 
(this will be addressed soon, i dont feel like messing with it right now) 
- this app will end your telnet session when you use it (big surprise) 
- This app is distributed "as-is", I am not responsible for anything that may happen to your computer as a result of using it. Back up your work and test this app in a "safe" situation before putting it to any real use. 
- that is all i can think of right now
