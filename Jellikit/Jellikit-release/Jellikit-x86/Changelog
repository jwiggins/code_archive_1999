Jellikit Changelog

0.9 beta 3
- Made Jellikit language neutral. You can now change all of Jellikit's displayed strings with a shell script.
- I _think_ I finally killed the weird bugs that reared their ugly heads whenever multiple file were open and switching between those files' windows would make the Edit window do strange things. If you catch any that you can reproduce, by all means mail me at john@ubermensch.net
- Finally brave enough to put all this madness on BeWare. Look out world.
- Fixed the BRect addon. It now supports editing too.
- Changed the Bool addon so that it looks like the Integer and String add-ons, both of which mimic attribute editing interfaces in DiskProbe.

0.9 beta 2 -
- Fixed crashing bug experienced when saving.
- Fixed a bug where you could add attributes with duplicate names from the Add Attribute window.
- Fixed the BoolAddon. It now works.
- Found a bug in BFilePanel. The open panel won't allow multiple selection.(even though I told it to) To work around this, just drag and drop multiple files from the tracker onto any Jellikit window. (except the edit window)
- Added IntegerAddon

0.9 beta 1 -
- Initial release. Too tired to know what bugs exist.
