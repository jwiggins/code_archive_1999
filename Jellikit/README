John Wiggins. 1998-1999

To use:
- Drag Files onto Jellikit's Tracker icon, use the 'open with' menu, or just double click Jellikit to start.
- To open more files while Jellikit is running, use the two methods already described, or drag and drop files from the Tracker onto a Jellikit window or use the 'Open File...' in Jelikit's file menu.
- A green dot next to an attributes name means that you have an addon that is able to edit that attribute.
- To copy attributes from file to file, just drag them between windows.
- To add or remove attributes to a file, use the function available in the edit menu.
- To edit an attribute, just click on it. If there is an add-on available for its type, it will appear in the edit window available for you to edit. Hit the 'ok' button when you are happy with your changes. This will apply the changes you made. To actually save them you need to choose 'Save' or 'Save As...' from the file menu.
