<h2>SheepShaver Update</H2><P>
25 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - SheepShaver received extensive updates.<P>

 Compatibility:<BR>
   SheepShaver runs MacOS 7.5.2 thru 8.1 with all system extensions like
   AppleGuide, AppleScript, QuickTime, QuickDraw 3D, Open Transport, PPP,
   Language Kits, ColorSync, etc. Applications we have successfully tested
   include PhotoShop 4.0, PageMaker 6.0, Illustrator 6.0, ClarisWorks 4.0,
   Netscape 3.0, RealPC, Marathon Trilogy, Quake and F/A-18 Hornet.
   The only real compatibility problem we have found so far (apart from
   incompatibilities due to as-yet unimplemented features) is that the
   QuickTime Cinepak decoder doesn't work. We are currently investigating
   this problem.<P>

 Graphics:<BR>
   8-bit windowed modes in 640x480 and 800x600 resolutions, and 8/16/24-bit
   full-screen modes in 6 standard resolutions (from 640x480 up to 1600x1200)
   are available. The full-screen modes are accelerated (acceleration is
   limited to rectangle blitting/filling/inversion for now). Video modes are
   switched with the MacOS Monitors control panel.<P>

 Sound:<BR>
   Sound output is in 44.1 kHz, 16-bit stereo. Seems to work fine.<P>

 Networking:<BR>
   SheepShaver supports Ethernet networking at the data-link level with an
   Open Transport Ethernet driver. This implies that the "Mac" and the "Be"
   side have two different network addresses. All protocol stacks should work
   correctly (we have tested AppleTalk and TCP/IP). The speed is still below
   expectations (perhaps a BeOS problem?). Network stability has been extensively
   tested during a 4 hour networked marathon session yesterday.<P>

 Serial communications:<BR>
   Both the modem and printer port are supported (on a BeBox, you can assign
   them to any of the 4 serial ports). MacOS terminal programs and
   Open Transport/PPP have been tested. For unknown reasons there are a lot
   of transmission errors (which might also be a BeOS problem).<P>

 Volumes:<BR>
   If a volume can be mounted under BeOS it can be mounted under ShapeShifter
   (this includes Zip/Jaz/SyQuest drives etc.), so you can continue to use your
   existing MacOS installation. Unlike BeOS, we also support HFS+. Additionally,
   you can use hard disk files and mount uncompressed disk images. SheepShaver
   also features a built-in CD-ROM driver with basic audio functions and a
   floppy disk driver.<P>

 Other features:<BR>
  - Text can be copied between the Mac and Be sides via the clipboard<BR>
  - The amount of RAM assigned to the MacOS is adjustable<BR>
  - Nifty 3D graphics in the "About" dialog<BR>
  - SheepShaver _does_ run on a BeBox, but you will have to provide a PowerMac
    ROM file yourself<P>

Under development:<BR>

 - Sound input<BR>
 - Copying of graphics via the clipboard<BR>

Features we are thinking about that will (probably) not be in the first
release but which might be implemented in the future:

 - Accelerated 3D graphics via QuickDraw RAVE<BR>
 - SCSI Manager 4.3 emulation<BR>
 - Access to ADB devices like graphics tablets, joysticks and dongles<BR>
 - Support for Bt848 video digitizers<BR>
 - MIDI<BR>
 - BeOS<->MacOS communications<P>
 
What will (probably) never be supported:<BR>

 - LocalTalk<BR>
 - Programs which access Mac hardware directly (the only one we've found
   so far is MacBench 4.0)<P>

As SheepShaver requires BeOS R3, its release is tied to the release of
BeOS R3 for PowerPC (which, according to Be, is in April). If you already
have access to BeOS R3 (i.e. you are beta testing (or developing for Be) you can contact 
them for becoming a SheepShaver beta tester. A public beta or demo will be released after 
the BeDC (mid-March), but unless you have BeOS R3, it will not be of much use to you.
