<h2>NetPositive Powered Up</h2><P>
NetPositive in BeOS R3 will not only support frames, it will support virtual hosts as well.
 NetPositive PR2 has problems 
with virtual hosts, and often sends users to the wrong location. Test your browser with <a 
href="http://www.macnn.com"
>MacNN</a>. If it shows MacNN, your browser supports HTTP 1.1 and virtual hosts.<BR>
NetPositive R3 will not allow you to enter a one-word url. For example, in NetPositive PR1,
 you could type in "beoscentral"
 and it would affix www. and .com on it's own, saving time as a result.<P>

<h2>BeOS Intel Incompatibilities</h2><P>

13 Feb 98 (YABOSCU) - <a href="http://www.be.com/support/qandas/faqs/faq-0458.html">BeOS 
Intel will not support internal modems</a> in it's initial release. Be says it is trying 
to focus first on getting BeOS Intel applications written before it moves on to other 
items, and does not want to wait until June to get BeOS Intel into the hands of developers.
