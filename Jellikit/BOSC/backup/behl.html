<h2>Hotline Updated</H2><P>
28 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - BeHL will support multiple connections. It will allow muti-
server connections and will have a "server" chooser window that swiches between the 
different servers chat, news, and tasks (may be shared). BeHotline is now a working 
application. It lacks a clean and attractive GUI and Hotline Tracker support.<P>

<h2>Hotline Updated</H2><P>

15 February 1998 (YABOSCU) -  Trip Software, developers of BeHotline, has updated it's 
Hotline client. It now supports users and chat. The software will be free, but is not yet 
publicly available. Tasks are working as well. The random crashing and instability has been, 
for the most part, fixed. According to a develper of BeHotline, "I have to get users to work 
RIGHT and most of the rest of the interface." Apparently, the user interface is still 
primitive.<P>
Hotline's capabilities include messaging, chat, server 
tracking, and file transfers. Originally for the Macintosh, it has expanded to Unix, Windows,
 and BeOS.<P>
Hotline for BeOS is an UNOFFICIAL version, and is completely unsupported by Hotline 
Communications (although not necessarily discouraged).  Furthermore, Trip Software has 
no relationship nor agreement with Hotline Communications.
