<h2>The Dope on Spektrum</h2>

25 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - PixelWizard was renamed to Spektrum. Also, Pixel Wizard was 
mentioned in a BeDope article and was said to be "creating an army of Wizards to control 
the world." For the paranoid and gullible: Spektrum is not <B>really</B> creating an army 
and if it did, it would not aim to take over the world.<P>

<h2>Magical Pixel Wizard</H2><P>


19 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - Apparently, another application under development named 
<A href="http://www.digitalarchetype.com/pm.cfm">Pixel Magic</a> had a similar name. The 
author, Matt Lewinski, is currently seeking a new name.

<h2>Pixel Wizard: Why No Screenshots?</H2><P>

19 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - Earlier, BeOS Central promised screenshots and inside 
information on Pixel Wizard, an up and coming image manipulator for BeOS. The author, Matt 
Lewinski, recently made some drastic changes to the software.<P>
Pixel Wizard is being rewritten and the UI has changed drastically. It would seem 
pointless to show documentation and screenshots for a program that looks and behaves 
completely different. Instead, more information will be available later this month.
