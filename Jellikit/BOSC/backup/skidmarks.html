16 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - A pre-pre-alpha test of SkidMarks for the BeOS shows the BeOS 
gaming community as being viable and strong.<P>
SkidMarks is an off-road track racing game with numerous tracks and levels of difficulty. 
Future versions will support multiplayer gaming and networking. This game definitely has 
lots of potential.<P>
Graphics are spectacular and sharp. Animation is amazingly smooth. Sound is wonderful as 
well. Add a subwoofer and you feel as if you're there on the tracks picking up the dirt. 
Game play is like Super Off-Road, a popular game for the IBM PC, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, 
Nintendo, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo.<P>
The tested version is very early and primitive. Lots of changes are in store for the 
future. At the moment, a few tracks work incorrectly and networking has not been 
implemented. The computer players are a bit awkward and screen resolutions are in need of 
repair. Look forward to future versions of this spectacular game.<BR>
