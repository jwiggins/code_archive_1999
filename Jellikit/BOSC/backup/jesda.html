<P>
I'm Jesda Gulati, webmaster at BeOS Central. I officially decided that I will leave BeOS Central 
as head webmaster and instead continue as a provider of information and editor. I am young, 
and must devote my time to enjoying my youth. I've truly enjoyed running this spectacular 
website and contributing and learning from the BeOS community.
<P>
This site would not exist without it's loyal and insighful readers. (I feel like I won an award). 
I have chosen an individual to continue developing and promoting BeOS Central. This individual 
will maintain BeOS Central's high standards of professionalism and accuracy.
<P>
Back in 1997, Jay Swartzfeger left BeOS Central and I had the honor of taking over the site. 
Jay also had problems with the lack of information from developers. BeOS Central grew and became 
something great beyond my expectations. Now, the same thing is happening. I do not have the time 
to give to being a webmaster. Maintaining BeOS Central consumes a lot of personal time that I 
simply cannot give. Time must be put into building an education and enjoying youth, while it 
lasts. It's best to leave BeOS Central while it's on a growth spike than when it's dissolving.
<P>
BeOS Central should return to "normal" in a couple of days. For the time being, enjoy Be Leading 
Edge and Believe.
<P>
I'll be working behind the scenes and spending the time I have contributing news, but I won't 
be on the forefront reporting it. It's been fun. Always remember this: Treat BeOS developers 
like god.
<P>
*sniff* (Holding back tears).

I'm signing off, everyone. Goodnight and god bless...<P>

Take care,<BR>
