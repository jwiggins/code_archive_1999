<A href="http://www.be.com/beware/Network/BeBlurb.html">BeBlurb</a> is one of the most 
unique and useful applications for the BeOS. BeBlurb lets you communicate with other 
BeOS users over the network.<P>

You can send simple text messages and attach files, and address your 
messages to multiple users. Users are identified by Person files, created 
by the People application.<P>

BeBlurb works with BMessages. The difference is, it sends a BMessage across the 
network to another machine. That's what message_daemon does. it routes a BMessage across 
the network and sends it on its way on the remote machine. So, there's absolutely ZERO 
networking code in BeBlurb. Message_daemon does the work.<P>

BeBlurb is going to have a lot more preferences, and message_daemon is going to be more 
robust, quicker, and more stable. Eventually, message_daemon will be rewritten, but it's 
more than an excellent proof of concept right now.<P>

Newer versions of message_daemon and BeBlurb are available. The older versions were much 
less stable and more cumbersome.<P>
