<h2>Zero Updated</H2><P>
24 February 1998 (YABOSCU) - Zero, the 3D game for BeOS, is progressing smoothly. Developers 
implemented code to allow cool gradient effects for sky and horizon rendering. More 
improvements were made to the Dirt Mound terrain editor. Also, vast improvements were made 
to the automatic landscape texturer, which will save a lot of time during level creation. 
Developers also made the illumination code more intelligent.

15 February 1998 (YABOSCU) -  Here is an <a href="http://www.r3.co.nz/products/zero/dirt01.
gif"> early screen shot</a> of Dirt Mound, the Zero terrain editor. The texture placement 
controls still need work, but overall the app is quite nice to use. By the way, this will be 
released with Zero.<P>
Zero is a 3-D action and adventure game with a science fiction theme that will be released 
for MacOS as well as BeOS.<P>
