<b>Background</b> 
<p>Team BeOS Central was started shortly after the start of the RC5-64 contest when John 
Wiggins found out that there was no BeOS related team. Since then, we have ascended to the 
upper half of the top 100 teams and we continue to tear through the keys.
<h3>Our team's number is: 1178 </h3>
