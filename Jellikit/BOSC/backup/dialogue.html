<h2>Teenagers</h2><P>
<I>23 February 1998</I><BR>
<blockquote>
Everyone is appealing to teenagers. Why? They're damn profitable. Hanson's sales are big 
on teenagers. The Spice Girls sell to the 11-14 age group. Even Yahoo is appealing to them 
by offering "Teen News" in it's personalized My.Yahoo service. "Teen News" is a stupified 
edition of the regular news. The words are reduced in complexity and content is flashier.
<P>
How does one appeal to a teenager? Start with sex. Candy-coat the sex with dreams. No, not 
a wet dream. It's a teenager's dream that they can be adults while their young. What a 
bunch of shit.<P>
<I>You're probably offended. Read on.</I><P>
Parents tend to cater to this nonsense by giving little twaddlehead the keys to his own 
BWM 328i convertible. What does he do? He takes his little whore on a date and later that 
night goes to a party and gets drunk. He zooms that mother fucking car to a dark place 
where he hopes to fuck his whore. Since he's so fucking drunk, he instead gets in a wreck 
and kills the poor little BMW.<P>
Mom and Dad punish him by making him drive the Lexus instead.<P>
Is it just me or did discipline and rules go to fucking hell? Whatever happened to earning 
your rewards? What ever happened to appreciating your parents for giving you a fucking 
life? Adolescents these days skip months of school and manage to pass classes. Education 
is another topic I will bitch on later.<P>
Parents supply them with not only the necessities to live a comfortable life, but also the 
accessories to be insanely spoiled. A person I know named (
hiddentokeepfromgettingsuedbecausehessodamnedspoiledhehashisownlawyer) got $25,000 from 
his grandmother. This boy is the most spoiled rotten individual I ever met. He treats his 
mother like crap and tells her to go to hell. She punishes him by giving him beer money. 
Back to the $25,000, he spent it on a brand new Subaru SVX. Is this great college money or 
what? If it were me, I'd put it in the stock market and earn my way up. This bastard not 
only received free money in a BIGASS SUM, he wasted it on a pimp car to use for fucking 
whores in. More on this later.<P>
