<h2>Future of YABOSCU</h2><BR>
<B>What's in store for the future of BeOS news sites and how did they become this way?</B><BR>
<I>28 February 1998</I><P><BR>
<I>For those of you who don't know, YABOSCU stands for Yet Another BeOS Central Update and is the main theme behind 
BeOS Central.</i><P>
It's been two happy years watching BeOS Central grow and flourish along with Be, 
Inc. and BeOS. One could easily conclude that the two entities grow together. 
Let's start from the beginning and trace our footsteps, shall we?<P>
In 1996, BeOS DR8 was available. Jay Swartzfeger, a hero of mine, the person who 
started BeOS Central, caught on to the BeOS and saw it's greatness and it's 
potential. At that time, there were two BeOS news sites: BeForever and BeOS 
Central. The two sites continued to grow and develop, becoming strong influences 
in the Be community. BeOS Central started as BeMacOS Central, a place for Mac 
users that wanted to or did convert to the BeOS.<P>
Later, these two sites ended up 
becoming a bit redundant, and BeOS Central consumed a lot of Jay's time. Finally, on September 17, 
1997, near the release of BeOS PR1, Jay Swartzfeger announced 
the official closing of BeOS Central. Well, a little geekling, named Jesda Gulati 
(hey, that's me!) came along and saw a great oppotunity. At the time, I was 
running a BeOS news site, growing rapidly, called Be Informed. Be Informed, 
admittedly, kind of sucked. I ran a site before called Macinsite, which was 
extremely informative and coated with layer upon layer of useful information. I 
discovered BeOS news was completely different. It was like taking CNN and narrowing it down 
to a single news item, and then trying to report only on that news item. I tried to find content, but 
the lack of recognition and marketing left Be Informed out in the cold. Be Informed, lacking original 
content, basically turned into a mirror for Be Leading Edge (BLE), Thijs Stalenhoef's top-rated BeOS 
news site.<P>
Thijs is another hero of mine. He's currently an employee at Be, Inc. Be Leading Edge is in the 
hands of new webmasters. Be Leading Edge grew rapidly, being the first to report on SheepShaver and 
Gobe Productive. Thijs really devoted a lot of time to BLE.<P>
In late December, BeForever closed unofficially. I think it's safe to conclude that no updates to a 
daily news site in two months makes it closed. Jody Sweeton, BeForever webmaster, is still active in 
the Be community.<P>
Now, before all of this, many other BeOS news sites closed near the release of BeOS PR1. 2 Be is 
closed, but the author says he still has plans for it. Buzz, Beyond, BeFirst, DoubleB, BeVersion, and 
BeIntouch all closed. Beintouch suddenly returned after about five months of silence. It's in French 
now. Other sites worth mentioning are Labielle, @Society, Slashdot, Be Happy, ZDNet's BeHive, and 
BeWorld. Links to all sites mentioned here can be found on the left column on <a href="http://www.
beforever.com">BeForever</a>.<P>
After all this was over, BeOS PR2 was released free to the public, sparking growth all over the Be 
community. A person named Jake Latham started <a href="http://www.napanet.net/~xredbear/index.shtml">Believe</a>, a 
growing BeOS news site. I did a review along with six other people at YABOSCU and we 
concluded that Believe sucked. We never gave it a chance, really. Now Believe is a flourishing site 
with daily content worth reading. Jake and I became colleagues and continued to assist each other. 
One of these days I'm going to do a new review on Believe.<P>
I must admit, with all the competition from new sites, I got scared. I was tinkering with new designs 
for BeOS Central and was looking for something to retain my hold on the BeOS news market. Be Leading 
Edge and BeOS Central were about even in readers and traffic at the time.<P>
Slaughtering Believe in a review was a mistake. BeOS Central lost a lot of credibility and many loyal 
readers. I blame John Wiggins. =) Believe received a boost in traffic after the review and started to 
tug on BeOS Central's tied-for-first position. By the way, Believe is a wonderful site worth reading.
<P>
BeOS Central continued to fall behind Be Leading Edge and Believe. Everyone and their dog had links 
to those two sites. Developers were ticked at my reporting on people like Justin Deal, as much as 
they hated him. (FYI: Justin Deal is a whiny brat that no one likes. He is (was?) a member of some 
BUG somewhere. I hope he's reading this.) Around that time, John Wiggins started Team BeOS Central, 
which did boost traffic and credibility. I blame John Wiggins. =) I fell to being the second-largest 
BeOS news site. Developers stopped sending me information and I was losing hope.<P>
Well, I got ambitious and took a risk. I redesigned the whole site. Everyone liked it. The new look 
was fresh and clean. I felt bad about moving away from Jay's design, and new designs in the past have 
slaughtered traffic. But I got lucky and it worked. Traffic jumped and BeOS Central was the highest-
rated BeOS news site, finally. I got a little more ambitious and hired Black Light Media, the company 
behind MacOS Rumors, to promote BeOS Central. Immediately, traffic doubled.<P>
So now, we have a group of BeOS news sites called The Big Three. BeOS Central, Be Leading Edge, and 
Believe make up this triangle of information delivery. Now, on the way, is BeOS R3 for Intel. Which 
one of The Big Three will cater best to the needs of BeOS Intel users? So far, Believe has the edge 
on Intel news. Perhaps a new site will take over the position of number one BeOS news site? No one 
really knows where Be is going and even less, where BeOS Central is going. Wherever it is, I hope 
it's a happy place. =)<P>
Now, what's in store for the future? Some of these ideas are <B>WHACKED</B>, but they're just ideas:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Make BeOS Central a printed magazine.<P>
Make a BeOS Central client. It will flash something or make a noise, like Eudora, when new news is 
available.<P>
Distribute a CD with BeOS Central's archives. Since I lost almost all of them, it's not going to 
happen. Scratch that idea.<P>
Sell mouse pads, keyboards, mice, mugs, t-shirts, drinks, and software plastered in "YABOSCU".<P>
Make a game based on Goobre Snap and Wozzle Woozle, two BeOS Central mascots.<P>
Make BeOS Central an official Olympic sponsor.<P>
Sell BeOS Central to Microsoft. =)<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
We've come a long way and it's still a fun ride. I look forward to what the computer industry has in store for us 
and what role BeOS plays in the future. Take care and best wishes to all of you and remember, BeOS software 
developers should be treated like gods.<P>
Peace out,<BR>
