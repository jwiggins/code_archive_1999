<h2>APlayer Updated</H2><P>

22 February 1998 (YABOSCU) -  A new version of <a href="http://home6.inet.tele.dk/jail/aplayer/aplayer.html">APlayer</a> for BeOS is available.<BR>
It has the following changes:<BR>
- Changed the menus a little bit and added online help.<BR>
- Fixed a bug in the mixer routine. It didn't move the sample pointer when 
a sample was played with volume 0.<BR>
- Changed the mime-type strings in the players to correct mime 
strings.<BR>
- Fixed problems where the left and right channels in the mixer were reversed.<BR>
- Fixed a lot of small and big bugs.<BR>
Modules are relatively small files which contains various soundsamples 
and information on how they should be played. This way of making music is 
going way back and even at the time of the Commodore 64 the concept 
were used.<BR>
But it was on the Amiga computer it really started off. The original type 
of modules were made with a program called SoundTracker, but since then a lot 
of different moduletypes has shown up. All of them offering different 
features such as more sound channels, more samples, realtime echo and so on.
APlayer is a program which can play these modules. APlayer did too start 
on the Amiga computer back in 1993, and was a reaction to the lack of 
good module players for the Amiga. Now the programmer (Thomas Neumann) has 
bought himself a Macintosh computer, and wants to make APlayer just 
as popular for the BeOS as it were for the Amiga.<P>
