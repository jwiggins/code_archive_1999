<a href="ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/util/">DataDock</a>: A window with 5 datawells will be created. You can then 
drag any item into one of the 5 datawells and then drag as many copys 
of the docked data out of the associated well. For instance you can 
drag text templates into the wells and then drag them back into your 
text area when needed, or you can drag images from Rraster. Anything 
that you can drag between applications can be stored into the DataDock.<BR>

<a href="ftp://ftp.be.com/pub/contrib/develop/pilot-link.zip">PalmPilot Communications Library</a> is a port of Kenneth 
Albanowski's Pilot Link for Unix 
code. Source code is available from the Pilot Link web site at (ftp://
ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS) and the diffs for compilation on 
BeOS are available from awk@be.com. The package includes a shared 
library of the pilot link code and relevant header files. The example 
binaries of the original Pilot Link source package build just fine against 
this shared library. Further information/documentation can be found in 
the original Pilot Link source archive from the above FTP site.

bookmarks. Full uncommented source is included.<P>

The following information from Opera Software indicates trouble with BeOS development. "The Be, Inc. guys have been 
very busy lately, but we are still trying to find a way to kickstart development. Again, it's mainly a matter of money, 
and in the case of BeOS, we are talking about a rewrite rather than a plain and less compliated 'port'."<P>
