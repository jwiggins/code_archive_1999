<p><b>[BeDC happenings]</b><br>
"They handed out beautiful full-pressed, labelled 2-CD sets R2 PPC. PPC R3
will be out "soon" (within 2 months). And everybody has a t-shirt with
"Asset of Be Inc." and a bar code on it.<br> I found Trey, the Intel
graphics driver guy, and he's sending me the source to the S3 ViRGE driver
so I can
make it work with VX.<br> What else...they went over the multiplatform
issues.
I was a tad bit disappointed; resources and dynamic linking are not 100%
compatible. So it turns out that many apps can't simply be recompiled. But 
the work is minimal.<br> Intel was here; the secret keynote speaker
was Intel's VP of developer relations, somebody Leglise. Intel is *very*
interested in BeOS, he said, because they see great promise in it and are
committed to working with Be. Intel does not actually own part of BeOS. 
He talked about markets for BeOS and said that Intel has never
really been able to hook digital content.<br> OH! MetroWorks is here! They
announced some EXCITING stuff:<br>
1) MW is now $129, unlimited uncrippled version<br>
2) MW for BeOS is being handled by Be for the next 5 years<br>
He brought out a roadmap (I hate that word) for future releases. R4 will
have more codecs, FAT32, USB, color printing, WAV and MOV format support,
Japanese input support, and composite and S-video input/output".<br>

<p><b>[MIDI Keys]</b><br>
MIDI Keys is a minimalistic little nifty tool for MIDI musicians. It
displays a visual keyboard on screen and lets the user interact with
mouse, keyboard or external MIDI controller. Furthermore it lets you
redirect the output to any MIDI port or the internal MIDI Synthesizer. You
can use MIDI Keys to make your computer's keyboard act as MIDI controller
(Soundtracker style), a patcher when redirecting MIDI or just to display
the played notes. It also makes use of libprefs if available and supports
funky roColor drops. <a

<p><b>[PedalBoard]</b><br>
Pedalboard is a realtime digital audio processor that does a few effects
popular with guitar players---fuzz distortion, delay (echo), and chorus.
This is a rough alpha version, but still usable and a good demonstration
of the power of BeOS audio streams. Works on any PowerPC BeOS machine (no
Intel version for now, sorry), even a BeBox/66, at 41.1 KHz. Just plug
your guitar into the audio input and jam!. <a

BePlan store your appointments in attributes in the filesystem. BePlan
needs date-xfer by ABiSoft to sync with the pilot. There is a link to it
on the BePlan webpage. <a

the OS, and has full pitchcontrol from -400% to 400%. As far as I know,

is now called BeOS Journal. The new site has been kicked off with a new

first impressions. Links to older BeHive pages will redirect properly
later today, and the preferred URL -- www.behive.com -- already points to
