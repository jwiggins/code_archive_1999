<b>[rc5 stats to be available "soon"]</b><br>
The stats server is currently on the logs for Feb. 26 (6:15 CST). It was at the beginning of 
February last night, so unless something really silly happens, 
<a href="http://rc5stats.distributed.net">rc5 stats</a> should be up and running late tonight 
or early tommorrow.(that is _my_ guess) Hopefully Team BeOS Central is still kicking butt.
