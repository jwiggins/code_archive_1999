<b>[net_restart updated]</b><br>
Yikes Batman! net_restart had a bad bug in it that would crash your computer if net_server wasn't 
running. Please get this <a href="net_restart.zip">update</a> if you use net_restart. A version 
will be on BeWare in a couple of days.

<b>[r3 out early for BeDC attendees]</b><br>
If you're going to the BeDC this probably isnt news to you, but Be sent out pre-release CD's 
with R3 Intel on them. Looks like there will be lots of programming in the days before BeDC! :)
