<b>[Mini-update from John Wiggins]</b><br>
Well, this was all a little hectic. I wasn't expecting to take over a news site tonight :). Jesda's
last update looks like a good amount of news for today. Tomorrow I will do the news and hopefully,
I'll have chatted a little bit more in detail with Jesda.(today's email consisting mostly of "You
want me to take over?" and "Ok, but what's the password?")<br>

Jaws .9 is available, a nice and easy to use web-serverfeaturing a live hierichal display of your web-site, wich counts 
hits on individual directories and files. Since it's very light-weight, it does not support CGI, users that want
such features should have a look at POW by stegemann&stegemann.<P>
