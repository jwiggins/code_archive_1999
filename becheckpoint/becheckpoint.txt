  Description:  BeCheckPoint is a login type application. When launched, it kills the Tracker and Deskbar, (and mail_daemon if its running). After killing off all the useful stuff :) you get a password prompt. You can't do much of anything until you enter your password (appropriately so :). After you enter a correct password, BeCheckPoint unkills everything it killed at startup and exits. Send me some email if you want the source.
