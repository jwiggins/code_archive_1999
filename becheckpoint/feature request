yup that's exactly what's needed.

yup, but you also need to save the locked state to disk so when it reboots it 
remembers.

and a final feature request while I'm at it *g*

in a future version add in "users" which are logged, for accounting purposes.
Something like an XDM except as a BeDM :)  Which if you run it will ask you if 
you want to Logout or Lock the terminal.  If you log out it kills all user 
running apps and the tracker and desk bar then puts up a login screen.  If you 
lock it does what BeCheckPoint was designed to do.  Plus a simple flag which 
tells the program to go straight to BeDM mode.
