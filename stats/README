stats v 1.0
by John Wiggins.
--------------------------
Stats is a simple shell program that tells you current statistics about your computer. It is especially usefull to you if you are logged into your computer. (the reason i wrote it in the first place :)
what stats does:
-shows cpu usage for all cpus
-shows local time and date
-shows uptime in days, hours, minutes
-shows how many threads are running
-shows used ram
-and last but not least, gives the answer to is_computer_on() ;-)

-------
v1.1
-------
took out the ram usage stat after I found out how completely inaccurate it was from a Be representative.

-------------
load v 1.0
-------------
cpu monitor from the terminal pure and simple.

Stats and load are freeware.
