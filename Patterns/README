Patterns v1.0
John Wiggins

This software is provided "as-is". I accept no responsibility if it does any damage to your computer. I have made sure to the best of my knowledge that is isnt a monster, but if anything bad happens don't come crying to me. (you get the idea already...)

Patterns is a silly little app that makes random animated patterns based on the position of a miniscule little scrollbar. Don't ask me how it works, because I was pretty damned amazed to find out what that changing scrollbar value could do.

Anywho. Because this app was basically just an exercise in messy code and general BeAPI classes, I have provided all the sources so that other people wishing to learn how to write BeApps could have some sample code to look at.

Enjoy!
